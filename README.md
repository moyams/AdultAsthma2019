Lab 4: Adult Asthma in the United States, 2019

This map was created to show the current number of Adult Asthma cases in the United States. I created the map using data from the CDC. The size of the circles were chosen to make small points visible and larger points not overpowering. I choose teal for my circle color to symbolize the awareness color for asthma. The title was larger than the other texts to demonstrate visual hierarchy. The additional information as well as the source and author were added in the bottom left corner to make more space for the map. I kept the original practice exercise base map because I felt that it highlighted the symbols well. The last thing I added was the legend. The legend was difficult to troubleshoot. Though I didnâ€™t figure out how to proportionally scale the data points. I learned a lot from the legend-making process and was able to customize and align the legend to be visually appealing.
